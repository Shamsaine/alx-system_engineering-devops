SPOF
	single point of failure is a weakness in the system that causes the entire system to shutdown or fail if there is failure at a single point in the infrastructure. the way the system is structured provides no alternative or back up and as a ressult has no fault tolerance.

Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
	This is because the infrastructure has a single server which has to be shut down or restarted during maintenance down time can not be avoid and continuous availability is interrupted. This is a huge problem for applications that need to run at all times.

Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
	this happens due to the lack of a load balancer to distribute the traffic efficiently.
