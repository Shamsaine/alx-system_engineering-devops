Behind the Scenes: Your Journey to Google
What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com In Your Browser
Have you ever wondered what happens in the blink of an eye when you type a web address into your browser and press Enter? It might seem like magic, but there's a fascinating sequence of events happening behind the scenes to bring you the information you seek. Today, we'll delve into the exciting world of web infrastructure and explore the journey your request takes to reach Google.
As a Full-Stack Software Engineer, understanding the intricate workings of a software system is crucial. One of the most fundamental interactions we have with the web is when we type a URL into our browser. In this post, we'll break down the entire process that occurs when you enter https://www.google.com and press Enter. When you initiate this web request, a symphony of technology springs into action, orchestrating a complex sequence of events that ultimately delivers the requested webpage to your screen. This journey, though appearing instantaneous, showcases the incredible engineering marvels that power the web stack starting with the DNS request.
The DNS Lookup - Demystifying the Address Book
The internet relies on a complex addressing system unlike the physical addresses we use for our homes. Websites don't have street names and door numbers; they have IP addresses, a unique numerical label assigned to each device on the network.
Imagine the internet as a giant city, and DNS (Domain Name System) acts as its phonebook. When you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser, it doesn't understand this human-readable format. So, the first step involves a DNS lookup.
•	Your browser contacts a DNS server, typically provided by your internet service provider (ISP).
•	The DNS server acts like a switchboard operator, looking up the IP address associated with "www.google.com" in its massive database.
•	Your browser checks its local DNS cache to see if it has recently resolved this domain. If not, it sends a request to a DNS server, which may involve multiple queries through a hierarchy of DNS servers until it finds the authoritative server for google.com.
•	Once the DNS server finds the matching IP address (e.g., 142.250.184.196), it relays this information back to your browser.
The DNS server responds with the IP address of the server hosting the website, allowing your browser to know where to send the request.
The TCP/IP Connection - Handshake on the Information Highway
Once the IP address is obtained, your browser establishes a connection using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) over the Internet Protocol (IP) using the three-way Handshake. Now that your browser has the IP address, it can initiate a connection with the Google server. Here's how it happens:
•	Your browser establishes a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection. Think of TCP as a reliable mail carrier ensuring your data packets (requests and responses) arrive in the correct order and without errors.
•	The browser initiates a handshake with the server, establishing a communication channel.
o	Your browser sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server.
o	The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet.
o	Finally, your browser sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server.
After this fascinating exchange, a reliable connection is established, allowing data to be sent back and forth.
Firewall
Firewalls act as security guards, monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic and filtering out potential threats to protect both you and Google's servers. Firewalls can be configured with rules to block suspicious traffic patterns or access attempts from unauthorized locations.
As the request travels through the internet, it may pass through various firewalls. These firewalls monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They protect the server from unauthorized access and potential threats.
The firewall allows legitimate traffic through while blocking malicious requests.
HTTPS/SSL: Request, Response, and Rendering (Secure Information Exchange)
Next, your browser initiates a secure connection using HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure), which employs SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols to add an extra layer of encryption. This is needed for the privacy and security of communication. It also involve a series of steps known as the SSL handshake. Just like the three-way handshake it involves a serious of back and for steps that occur in other to establish secure transfer of files over the connection created by the TCP. The SSL handshake involves several steps:
	Your browser requests a secure connection.
	The server responds with its SSL certificate, which includes its public key.
	Your browser verifies the certificate against trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
	A session key is generated for encrypting the data.
After this steps, secure, encrypted connection is established, ensuring that data exchanged between your browser and the server remains private and secure.
Once the secure connection is established, the request is directed to a load balancer. The load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. This enhances performance and reliability.
The load balancer forwards your request to one of the available web servers. The web server receives the request and processes it. The web server is responsible for serving the static part of the google website that is the content, such as HTML, CSS, and images. It retrieves the necessary files from its storage and prepares to send them back to your browser. The web server sends the requested resources back through the established connection. 
For dynamic content, the request may need to be processed by an application server. The application server handles the business logic of the application. It processes requests that require interaction with databases or other services. It generates a response, often in the form of HTML, JSON, or XML, and sends it back to the web server.
If the application server needs to retrieve or store data, it interacts with a database. The database plays a crucial role in persisting user data, facilitating data-driven functionality, and ensuring efficient data access and manipulation. This allows web applications to provide personalized, real-time experiences based on user interactions and stored information. The application server sends a query to the database, which retrieves the necessary data or performs the required operations (like insert, update, delete).
The database returns the data to the application server, which then incorporates it into the final response sent back to your browser. This process of returning the response back to the users browser in the form of googles home page is called Rendering.
In a Nutshell, From the clever Domain Name System (DNS) that resolves domain names to IP addresses, to the secure communication protocols like HTTPS/SSL that protect your data, each component plays a vital role in the seamless web experience you enjoy. Load balancers ensure efficient distribution of traffic, while firewalls safeguard servers from potential threats. Web servers, application servers, and databases work in harmony to process your request and generate the desired content.
This intricate interplay of various technologies and protocols happens within milliseconds, a testament to the incredible infrastructure that powers the internet. As a Full-Stack Software Engineer, understanding these processes is crucial not only for building robust and efficient web applications but also for engaging in deeper discussions during interviews and professional settings.
The web, like a well-rehearsed orchestra, is a marvel of human ingenuity and technological prowess. Each component, from the smallest packet to the mightiest server, contributes to the harmonious symphony that allows us to access information at our fingertips. By comprehending the mechanisms behind a simple web request, we gain a deeper appreciation for the engineering marvels that shape the digital world we inhabit.
